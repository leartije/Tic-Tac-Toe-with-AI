# Tic-Tac-Toe-with-AI
JetBrains project in 5 stages

### Stage 1/5: Initial setup

Learn how to work with the table and its coordinates. 

### Stage 2/5: Easy does it

Create an easy difficulty level where the computer just makes random moves: simple to write and not too challenging to beat. 

### Stage 3/5: Watch 'em fight

Choose whether you want to play with a friend or take a break and watch computers battle it out! 

### Stage 4/5: Signs of intelligence

It's time to add a medium difficulty level. This AI should be a lot harder to beat! Are you up to the challenge? 

### Stage 5/5: An undefeated champion

Oh no, what have we created here? An unbeatable AI monster! Indeed, this complex algorithm guarantees a win or a draw.
